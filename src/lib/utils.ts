/* For a given date, get the ISO week number
 *
 * Based on information at:
 *
 *    http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekcalc.htm#WNR
 *
 * Algorithm is to find nearest thursday, it's year
 * is the year of the week number. Then get weeks
 * between that date and the first day of that year.
 *
 * Note that dates in one year can be weeks of previous
 * or next year, overlap is up to 3 days.
 *
 * e.g. 2014/12/29 is Monday in week  1 of 2015
 *      2012/1/1   is Sunday in week 52 of 2011
